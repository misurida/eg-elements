## \<EgBtn\>

The Btn element can be used to display a `<button>` tag quickly. It has multiples styles availables that can be set through the components attributes (*props*), and can display icons on the left or the right. You can set the button style, but also change its state to `loading` to display a loader, `disabled` to to lock it or `error` and `warning` to display a quick style layer on top of the regular style.

The `@click` event is transmitted, and you can insert the button text or any html code in the default slot (between the tags).
The attributes are described on the table below, and you can set only one *style* and one *type*, but multiple *state* attributes.

**Attributes**

The attributes are summarized in the table here, and are described in a list containing the name of the attribute, the type of value and the default value between parenthesis, and its description.
